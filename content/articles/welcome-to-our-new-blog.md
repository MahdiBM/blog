After a lot of thinking by the Vapor team, we have decided to move away from Medium. Medium have been a great system for us to get an easy blog going in the beginning. Medium have a lot of great features

* Community and visibility
* Nice UI, makes it easy to manage
* Publications

But there are also things in Medium we find problematic

* Comment system is a bit strange
* WYSIWYG, which is good for many people, however we like Markdown
* Aggressive marketing for signup and paywall

These problems in the end made us decide to look into building a new blogging system. The process was actually quite easy, the blog is built using Hugo, and open source static site generator built using Golang. And an open source theme.

We hope you will enjoy our new Blog, as we will try to add new content more frequently than we have done in the past, for easy collection, we have moved all previous blog posts to the new blog.
